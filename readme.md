**To Do**
I set of a bit adventrous for 4Hrs work and planed for selection of hou temo should be shown. I have created the functions for this but they are not connected up.

I have wrtten 2 unit tests as examples but in final app there woudld be more

Error handling - at the moment is does not inform the user if somthing fails

UI - I have not had time to design the app so this need lots of work, I found some weather Icons and hoped to put these in the cells but did not get time

I would have split the UI in to 2 pages using page view if I hade more time and shown day on one page and week on the next

I included cocoapods but no pods I was hoping to include  (https://cocoapods.org/pods/Mockingjay) to be able to create test with stubbed APIs

Build
If I was building a real prject I would manage this through Fastlane where iOS certificates and add https://github.com/orta/cocoapods-keys to manage the API key.
